								<p>The most exciting moment for me is when I start seeing order in something that looked like a chaos a moment ago. The dots are not random anymore there are connections. That’s one of the reasons why I love software development. I love to talk to domain experts to translate complexity of their area into simple and useful models. And then to manage the complexity of current tools, languages and frameworks to implement the models creating stable and predictable software. You create something from nothing. How cool is that!</p>
								<p>I started this blog to share my excitement with you. I understand that programming is not a topic for everyone that’s why I extracted it into a separate partition. So, feel free to visit a section that is interesting for you and see what’s there. Feel free to comment on the posts. And let’s start turning confusion into clarity together!</p>

								<p>Who am I? It seems to be a simple question. I'll try to answer it.</p>
								<p>My name is Alexander Konoplev. But my name won't say much about me. A name is such a convenient way to contact someone so that all interlocutors understand who is the addressee. Or I could use my name to sign a text to let everyone know that the text's author is me. But who is this "me"?</p>
								<p>Then people usually talk about their experiences. For example, I studied at the university for 5 years and as confirmation of this fact I have a diploma in which it is written what kind of knowledge I received. Or I've been working as a software developer for 14 years. But our knowledge and even our experience do not quite accurately describe a person. The fact that I know math and some computer science is unlikely to help you understand whether I have, for example, a sense of humor.</p>
								<p>I love to travel. I started hatching the idea of this blog while being in Sri Lanka, I realized how the blog should look visually while walking in the winter Vienna, the themes of the first posts appeared when we traveled by yacht in the Mediterranean, this text was written on the beach in Nice. I love to walk in the park in the morning, listening to Beethoven's 9th symphony, Red Hot Chili Peppers or just birds singing and wind noise in the branches. I love programming because this is creativity in its pure form - I create something out of nothing (this blog, for example). Here I will talk a lot about programming because I love to share knowledge, I love to make complex things understandable. But all these "love" is how I manifest myself. Again, they do not answer the question who I am. It is like trying to understand by a taste of honey what color the flowers were, the nectar of which the bees collected for honey.</p>
								<p>"I" is just a symbol looking like Roman numeral 1 (the priority number which most of the people assign to themselves). "I" looks like a delimiter, a border between the world and a person. I wrote or said "I" and everything seems to be clear. But if you spend some time thinking about it, then there are more questions than answers. I have a name, I have knowledge and experience, I manifest myself somehow, but all these facts do not convey the essence. Yesterday I wanted to communicate a lot, but today I am full of inspiration and on the contrary, I want solitude so that no one distracts me from work. And all this is me. So I do not have an answer to the question "Who am I?". Not yet. As you can see, I love asking questions and looking for answers. And I do it on the pages of my blog also. I would be happy if you join this adventure! Maybe we have the same questions, or they are different and I know the answers to yours, and you to mine. Anyway, it should be interesting. Glad you're here!</p>
